# Learning Objectives
. Distinguish between probability and non-probability sampling<br>
. Describe the concept of a sampling distribution, and how one can make inference about a population parameter based on the estimated features of that distribution<br>
. Identify appropriate analytic techniques for probability and non-probability samples<br>
. Explain how poorly-designed samples can lead to descriptions of population features that are biased in nature<br>
